        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p><em>Warcraft III</em> combines classic base-building and resource management with tactical army control and hero progression. Players choose from four distinct factions — Humans, Orcs, Night Elves, and Undead — each with unique units, buildings, and playstyles.</p>
        <p>Central to the gameplay are powerful Hero units that level up, gain new abilities, and equip items, blending RTS mechanics with RPG elements. Players gather gold and lumber, build structures, train armies, and wage war across diverse fantasy battlefields.</p>

        <h2>Factions and Heroes</h2>
        <p>Each race in <em>Warcraft III</em> offers a unique strategic identity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humans:</strong> Versatile and defensive, featuring magic and mechanical units.</li>
            <li><strong>Orcs:</strong> Aggressive and resilient, with strong melee units and shamanistic spells.</li>
            <li><strong>Night Elves:</strong> Stealthy and mobile, with a focus on ranged attacks and ancient magic.</li>
            <li><strong>Undead:</strong> Necromantic and durable, capable of raising the dead and overwhelming enemies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heroes like Arthas, Thrall, and Illidan are central to both single-player campaigns and competitive multiplayer, offering powerful abilities and game-changing ultimates.</p>
