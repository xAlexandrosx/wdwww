        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Slay the Spire</em> is a critically acclaimed roguelike deck-building game developed by indie studio MegaCrit. It blends elements of card games and strategy with roguelike progression, offering a unique, replayable experience each time you ascend the mysterious Spire.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Players choose one of several characters—each with a unique card pool and playstyle—and navigate through procedurally generated paths filled with enemies, treasure, shops, and events. The core mechanic revolves around building a deck of cards by selecting new cards after each battle, balancing offense, defense, and synergy.</p>
        <p>Combat is turn-based and tactical, with players using cards drawn from their deck each turn to attack enemies, block damage, or apply strategic effects like poison or strength. Managing energy, card draw, and deck size is essential to surviving the increasingly difficult floors of the Spire.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>The game features several playable characters, each offering a distinct strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Ironclad:</strong> A bruiser with high health and powerful attack cards.</li>
            <li><strong>The Silent:</strong> Specializes in poison, card draw, and evasion tactics.</li>
            <li><strong>The Defect:</strong> A robotic character that utilizes magical orbs with unique effects.</li>
            <li><strong>The Watcher:</strong> A monk-like fighter with stance-based mechanics for high-risk, high-reward play.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relics and Strategy</h2>
        <p>Throughout a run, players collect relics that provide permanent passive effects, drastically shaping how each playthrough unfolds. From bonus energy to enhanced card effects, relics add another strategic layer to every decision. Success in <em>Slay the Spire</em> often comes down to adapting your strategy based on the cards and relics you're offered.</p>

        <h2>Challenge and Replayability</h2>
        <p><em>Slay the Spire</em> is renowned for its replay value. With procedurally generated maps, hundreds of cards and relics, and an “Ascension” system that adds difficulty layers, every run offers a fresh challenge. Daily climbs and custom game modes further expand the game's longevity.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><em>Slay the Spire</em> masterfully combines card-based combat with roguelike progression, offering deep strategic gameplay and near-infinite replayability. Its elegant mechanics and tight design have influenced a new wave of deckbuilding games and made it a modern classic in indie gaming.</p>
