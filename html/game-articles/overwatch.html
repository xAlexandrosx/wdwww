            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> High-impact attackers who focus on eliminating enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Tank:</strong> Frontline heroes who absorb damage and create space for their team.</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Healers and utility characters who sustain and boost allies.</li>
