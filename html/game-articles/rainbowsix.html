Each Operator has a unique loadout and ability, such as breach charges, deployable shields, heartbeat sensors, or EMP grenades.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attackers:</strong> Specialize in breaching defenses and gaining map control.</li>
            <li><strong>Defenders:</strong> Focus on fortifying positions and repelling enemy advances.</li>
        </ul>
