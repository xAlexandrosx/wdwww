        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> is a gothic roguelike turn-based RPG that emphasizes the psychological toll of adventuring. Developed by Red Hook Studios, it tasks players with managing a roster of heroes as they explore haunted ruins, fend off eldritch horrors, and grapple with mounting stress and madness. The game is praised for its grim atmosphere, punishing difficulty, and distinctive narrator.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Players manage a group of adventurers who embark on dangerous expeditions into procedurally generated dungeons. Combat is turn-based, with positioning, class synergy, and resource management playing key roles. In addition to physical damage and status effects, characters also accumulate stress, which can lead to mental afflictions or even heart attacks.</p>
        <p>Outside of combat, players must upgrade their Hamlet, recruit and train new heroes, and treat ailments both physical and psychological. Losing a hero is permanent, and surviving characters often return traumatized and less reliable, forcing the player to adapt constantly.</p>

        <h2>Classes and Strategy</h2>
        <p><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> features a variety of character classes, each with distinct abilities and quirks. From the sword-wielding Crusader to the fragile but powerful Plague Doctor, party composition is vital. Success depends on carefully balancing offense, healing, stress relief, and formation across multiple dungeon runs.</p>
        <p>Heroes also develop positive and negative quirks over time, further shaping their behavior. A character might become obsessed with loot, fearful of certain monsters, or refuse healing depending on their mental state and past experiences.</p>

        <h2>Visual Style and Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>The game’s distinctive hand-drawn art style, heavy shadows, and grim color palette establish a dark, foreboding tone. This is enhanced by an unforgettable voiceover from narrator Wayne June, whose brooding commentary intensifies the game's oppressive mood and themes of despair, futility, and madness.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <p><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> received widespread acclaim for innovating within the roguelike and RPG genres. Its focus on psychological stress as a gameplay mechanic influenced many subsequent titles. The game’s success led to expansions such as <em>The Crimson Court</em> and <em>The Color of Madness</em>, and eventually a full sequel, <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em>, which expands upon its predecessor's core ideas with new systems and visuals.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> is a challenging, atmospheric experience that rewards careful planning and punishes carelessness. With its rich mechanics, haunting aesthetic, and emphasis on the mental toll of adventure, it stands as a unique and influential title in the world of indie strategy games.</p>
