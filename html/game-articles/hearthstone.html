            <li><strong>Standard:</strong> The primary competitive mode using cards from the latest expansions.</li>
            <li><strong>Wild:</strong> Includes all cards released in the game’s history.</li>
            <li><strong>Battlegrounds:</strong> An auto-battler mode where eight players recruit minions and battle automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Arena:</strong> A drafting format where players build a deck on the spot and try to win as many games as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Duels and Tavern Brawls:</strong> Unique, often experimental modes offering new ways to play.</li>
        </ul>
