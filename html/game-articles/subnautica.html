        <h2>Game Modes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Survival:</strong> The default experience with hunger, thirst, and oxygen management.</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> Like Survival but without hunger and thirst mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardcore:</strong> One life, no respawns — death ends the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative:</strong> Unlimited resources and oxygen, with all tools and structures unlocked.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Community and Modding</h2>
