        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>In <em>Dota 2</em>, two teams of five players compete on a symmetrical map, each defending their base while attempting to destroy the enemy’s Ancient — a large structure located deep within the opposing territory. Each player selects a unique hero from a pool of over 120, each with distinct abilities and roles.</p>
        <p>Gameplay emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and timing. Players earn gold and experience by defeating enemy units and heroes, allowing them to level up, gain powerful items, and unlock new abilities. Matches are known for their depth, variety, and potential for dramatic comebacks.</p>

        <h2>Heroes and Roles</h2>
        <p><em>Dota 2</em> features a wide array of heroes that fulfill different strategic roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carry:</strong> Heroes who scale well into the late game and become powerful damage dealers.</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Heroes who protect teammates, provide healing or crowd control, and manage vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Offlane:</strong> Durable heroes who disrupt the enemy and absorb pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Mid Lane:</strong> Solo heroes with strong early power spikes and game-changing abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Jungler (Situational):</strong> Heroes who farm in the jungle rather than a lane, helping pressure the map.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Esports and Community</h2>

        <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
        <p><em>Dota 2</em> is renowned for its steep learning curve, strategic depth, and limitless gameplay variation. It has influenced countless other MOBAs and continues to serve as a benchmark for complexity and high-level competition in the genre.</p>
        <p>Its legacy is cemented not just by its global popularity, but by its role in shaping modern esports and redefining what free-to-play games can offer.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
