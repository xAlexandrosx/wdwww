        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Bloons Tower Defense</em> (also known as <em>Bloons TD</em> or <em>BTD</em>) is a popular tower defense game series created by Ninja Kiwi. Originally launched as a simple web-based Flash game, the series has evolved into a deep and engaging franchise, with <em>Bloons TD 6</em> standing as its most advanced and content-rich installment.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>In <em>Bloons TD</em>, players must stop waves of colorful balloons — or "bloons" — from reaching the end of a path. This is done by strategically placing towers, primarily monkey-based defenders, that pop the bloons using various attacks and abilities.</p>
        <p>Each tower type can be upgraded along multiple paths, offering increased power, range, or special effects. As the rounds progress, bloons become faster, more durable, and more varied — including camo bloons, lead bloons, and powerful MOAB-class enemies — requiring smart placement and upgrade strategies.</p>

        <h2>Monkeys and Strategy</h2>
        <p>One of the series’ trademarks is its creative use of monkeys as tower types. These range from Dart Monkeys and Tack Shooters to high-tech Super Monkeys and strategic support towers like Banana Farms and Monkey Villages.</p>
        <p>Each tower offers multiple upgrade trees, and in <em>Bloons TD 6</em>, players can unlock powerful Tier 5 upgrades and unique "Paragons" that combine the strength of all upgrade paths. Player knowledge and resource management are key to beating higher difficulty maps and game modes.</p>

        <h2>Progression and Modes</h2>
        <p>Modern entries like <em>BTD6</em> offer extensive content: dozens of maps, difficulty levels, challenge modes, daily events, and co-op multiplayer. Players can earn monkey money to unlock cosmetics, heroes with unique abilities, and power-ups to assist in difficult scenarios.</p>
        <p>The game is designed for both casual play and competitive mastery, with leaderboard events and community-created challenges adding to the replayability.</p>

        <h2>Community and Legacy</h2>
        <p><em>Bloons TD</em> has maintained a loyal fanbase over more than a decade. What started as a simple Flash game has become one of the most successful tower defense franchises, praised for its polish, humor, and strategic depth. Ninja Kiwi continues to support the games with regular updates and new content.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><em>Bloons Tower Defense</em> is a shining example of how a simple concept can grow into a rich, long-lasting franchise. With its blend of colorful visuals, engaging strategy, and endless replayability, it remains a favorite among tower defense fans of all ages.</p>
